# Ice Bath

Quick and dirty app to read the temperature of an ice bath and kick off a notification when it reaches the danger zone

### Next steps
* Tests
* Add timing, probably doesn't need to return the temp every second (10 mins will do)
* Interface to specify cook time and temp, without this there's no point in using the API
* Remove IFTTT integration and utilise Joule API
